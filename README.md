# 🛠️ UpdateIssue SDK

**UpdateIssue** is a lightweight JavaScript/Node.js SDK that helps you **monitor and report service failures** in projects that run on autopilot.  

It’s designed to keep you awake when things break — whether it’s an AI chatbot running out of credits, a failed payment attempt, an API outage, or any other unexpected error in your application.  

With just **one line of code inside `catch`**, you can instantly report issues to your backend and trigger alerts (Discord, Slack, Email, PagerDuty, etc.).
